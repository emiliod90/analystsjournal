### System / Applicayio Context Diagram (C4)

A System Context diagram provides a starting point for diagramming and documenting a software system, showing how the software system in scope fits into the world around it.

### Container Diagram

A Container diagram zooms into the software system in scope, showing the high-level technical building blocks.

In the C4 model, a container represents an application or a data store. A container is something that needs to be running in order for the overall software system to work. (Not to be confused with Docker!)
