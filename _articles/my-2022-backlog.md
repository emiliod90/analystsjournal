## 2022 Objectives

There were a few things from 2021 that I (ashamedly) did not find time for. These were:

- Get certified as an Azure Associate Developer
- Build my little brothers portfolio website
- Create a fictional website (real-estate investment) to showcase to a potential client 

After joining Redkite in October 2021, the Directors and I also talked about my career development to fit an Enterprise Architect role. My 2022 development plan for work looks something like this:

- Strengthen my understanding of the fundamentals:
    - Network architecture
    - Databases and data storage technologies
    - ETL/ELT & data transformation technologies
    - Messaging technologies
    - Data Security
- Get certified in:
    - TOGAF
    - Azure Expert Architect
- Support the architecture team with client work and Business Development 

Additionally, there's a few personal projects I really want to build, for fun and regular use:

- A portfolio tracker and alert application
- A website for sharing content and blogging (Analysts Journal!)

### Agile for One

I've been a massive fan of Trello over the years for creating to-do lists and managing tasks. However, this year I wanted to upgrade my productivity game, so I got myself a whiteboard and a multi-pack of colourful post-it notes. (Though they are not that colourful, truth be told).

Having my tasks listed nearby helps me to regularly plan what I want to achieve that day and over the course of the following weeks. It also serves as a useful reminder to reflect and evaluate whether a particular course of action is aiding my longer term goals.

In terms of my personal execution of agile, I prefer to set myself 1 week sprints - this  allows me enough flexibility to balance my projects with work and social time. Sprint planning is also easier, as I know once I commit to a particular user story, I'm in a race against myself to meet the week deadline.

I find that spending sufficient time to really break down user stories has been one the biggest factors in planning for success. Furthermore, I like to plan for exploratory analysis, or "research". Taking time to understand a topic or domain in greater depth is a luxury that I can afford for my personal projects. Contrast this to my day job where a client request will regularly push me outside of my comfort zone and ultimately help me learn new skills. Learning "in the deep end" / "trial by fire" certainly has its advantages - and it's a major reminder to myself to make sure I don't spend too much time "exploring" vs "building" ! 

(Note: We have a segment on "Agile for One" you can find here - where we provide guidance how to execute agile successfully for managing your personal projects or start-up ideas).
