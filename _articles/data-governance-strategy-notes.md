### Key Challenges
- Cultural change
    - Must not be seen as a one-off project
    - *Change Management* is needed!
- Data is not sexy
    - Focus on the outcomes of what data governance enables
- Not the top priority
    - Explain the value of Data Governance as it relates to top priorities
- Lack of scope and roadmap
    - Resource and implement in a phased, iterative approach
- Legacy systems
    - Identify the constraints and limitations of legacy systems early!

### Relationship with other data management disciplines
Data management is the umbrella term for everything shown on the wheel.
Data Governance is one of the data management disciplines. 

Data Governance is shown in the centre as it supports the other disciplines.

Data Governance shares a very close relationship with **Data Quality** and **Master Data Management (MDM)**. 

Business definition:
- **Data Quality**: Ensuring that data is accurate and fit for its intended use or purpose
- **MDM**: The capability to establish and maintain high quality, shared master data assets through clear design and implementation of governed data management

Laymans definition:
- Data Governance is the framework, policies, roles and processes
- Data quality is the monitoring, validation and correction of data
- MDM is the management of master data using processes to match, merge and manage data quality

*"Data Quality without Data Governance is tactical at best"* - Nicola Askham
