## Behavioural Diagrams

### Use case Diagram

(From TOGAF) A Use-Case diagram displays the relationships between consumers and providers of Business/Application services.

Services are consumed by actors or other services and the Use-Case diagram provides added richness in describing business capability by illustrating how and when that capability is used.

### Flow Charts (BPMN)

Also called Process Flow Diagrams, Activity Diagrams (UML), and Swimlane Diagrams, Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) is a flow chart method that models the steps of a planned business process from end to end.

Flow charts may utilize swim-lane techniques to represent ownership of process steps and typically include controls, triggers and sub-processes.

Flow charts can also be modelled from the perspective of a user in UX/UI, via:
- Customer Journey Maps
- Task flows
- Wireflows
