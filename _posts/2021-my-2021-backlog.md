## 2022 Objectives

There were a few things from 2021 that I (ashamedly) did not find time for. These were:

- Get certified as an Azure Associate Developer
- Build my little brothers portfolio website
- Create a fictional website (real-estate investment) to showcase to a potential client 

After joining Redkite in October 2021, the Directors and I also talked about my career development to fit an Enterprise Architect role. My 2022 development plan looks something like this:

- Strengthen my understanding of the fundamentals:
    - Network architecture
    - Databases and data storage technologies
    - ETL/ELT & data transformation technologies
    - Messaging technologies
    - Data Security
- Get certified in:
    - TOGAF
    - Azure Expert Architect

Additionally, there's a few personal project I really want to build, for fun and regular use:

- A portfolio tracker and alert application
- A website for sharing content and blogging (Analysts Journal!)
